My name is Laurel Barrett. I decided to take Computer Sciencer 103, Electronic Textiles, to push myself out of my comfort zone and learn TWO new skills in one class -- basic programming and sewing. The idea of creating and presenting a project of my own at the end of the semester stuck out to me the most, as it will be a concrete symbol of the skills I acquired. 

Computers and programming was never my thing growing up, but it's never too late to add to your skill-set! I'm excited to improve my problem-solving skills, NOT lose my patience, and be able to hopefully use what I learn in this introductory course in other avenues in my life, whether it be creating a website of my own in the future for my career or embroidering or sewing as a relaxing pass-time. I can't wait to see what else this semester full of firsts brings!
