# College, sewing, and programming -- new to all three!

## College Experience

My name is Laurel Barrett and I'm a freshman at Williams College. I am planning on double majoring in American Studies and Comparative Literature on the pre-law track. 

Here's a picture of a cork board I made over the summer for my dorm room!

### Sewing and Programming Experience

While I love a good craft, and I have tried to teach myself how to sew, it hasn't come natural to me. I once sewed the opening of a t-shirt sleeve together semi-successfully, but that's about it. I've tried knitting, too, and that was a little bit less frustrating to learn. I knitted a ratty-looking scarf for my little brother a couple years ago that was full of holes -- that's where my knitting journey ended. I would love to learn embroidery, basic sewing, and how to knit or crochet small projects! 

As for programming, I have no experience. In elementary school I was kind of forced to participate in a coding unit, but it was a free-for-all environment and I didn't know where to start. That frustrated me and turned me off from the subject for the time being. There was a point where I was partnered up with a friend from school and we "coded" a game, but to be honest I was not much help, not for lack of trying. I wouldn't say I'm oblivious to the workings of the internet, but it certainly doesn't come naturally to me. I'm excited to learn for real in this class, though!

#### My Goals for Electronic Textiles

My goals for this semester are to become more comfortable with programming, learn how to sew, for real this time, navigate successfully through failures with GOOD patience, and to create something at the end of the semester that I am proud of!

##### Finally, One Boring Fact About Me Is.....

My favorite month of the year is November! November is the month where it finally feels like fall in New Jersey and stops being humid, the leaves become crunchy under my feet, and I've found a groove in school. Also, some of my favorite memories have been in November -- going back to my favorite city, Boston, in the fall this time, with my mom and friends and meandering through The Common at midnight; seeing the only musical I tolerate -- Hamilton -- in Philadelphia; going on nature walks with my 6-year-old brother; and experiencing a full New England fall here at Williams!
